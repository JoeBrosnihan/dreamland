# dreamland
game engine

First, an exploration of interesting technology. Then, a platform for content.

I currently work on rendering at Roblox. This project is partly motivated by a desire to explore the interesting rendering tech that doesn't fit our product.

## Philosophy

* Deferred renderer
* No offline baking
* Specific features and effects; no attempt to be generic
* Outside of rendering, prefer 3rd party code for complex features

## Roadmap

* Rendering ground work
* Import 3d models
* Character Controller
* HDR
* TXAA
* Motion Blur
* Depth of Field
* Terrain
* SSR, SSGI
